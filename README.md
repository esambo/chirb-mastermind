# Codebreaker
A game.

## Summary
This is a little code sample to solve the codebreaker feature **"codebreaker submits guess"** in a *BDD* fashion (outside in TDD).

## Origin
This is based on [The RSpec Book](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/achbd/the-rspec-book) Beta 12.  
The print edition of this book uses [Bulls and cows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_cows) which uses numbers instead of colors.

## Technologies
Technologies used are:

 * [Ruby 1.9.2]
